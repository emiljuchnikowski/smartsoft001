## 🛠️ Controllers & Methods

### CrudController
<table>
    <tr><td>POST /</td><td>create — Creates a new entity. Returns the new entity's ID.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>POST /bulk</td><td>createMany — Creates multiple entities in bulk.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GET /:id</td><td>readById — Retrieves an entity by its ID.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GET /</td><td>read — Retrieves a list of entities with filtering, CSV, and XLSX export support.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PUT /:id</td><td>update — Updates an entity by its ID.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PATCH /:id</td><td>updatePartial — Partially updates an entity by its ID.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DELETE /:id</td><td>delete — Deletes an entity by its ID.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>POST /attachments</td><td>uploadAttachment — Uploads one file. Requires a JWT and an <code>attachmentPolicy</code> that allows <code>create</code>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GET /attachments/:id</td><td>downloadAttachment — Downloads a file. JWT optional; the policy must allow <code>read</code>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DELETE /attachments/:id</td><td>deleteAttachment — Deletes a file. Requires a JWT and a policy that allows <code>delete</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

## 🔒 Attachment access

The attachment routes are denied unless `SharedConfig.attachmentPolicy` returns exactly `true`. The
policy is called with `{ operation, id, user }` (`operation` is `create`, `read` or `delete`) before
storage is read or changed. A valid JWT is not ownership: resolve owner, tenant and roles from data
the server trusts, and never return an unconditional `true` for private files.

- **Linking a file to its uploader.** For `create`, the controller generates the id first and passes
  it to the policy before reading the body. Record `user` against that `id` there and return `true`;
  later `read` and `delete` checks look the id up. A rejected upload can leave a record for an id
  with no file.
- **The stock Angular UI sends no token for files.** The PDF and attachment displays open files
  with `FileService.download` (`window.open`), and the image, video and `smartFileUrl` displays load
  `FileService.getUrl` as plain URLs, so these are anonymous reads. With the stock UI, allow
  anonymous `read` for files meant to be viewable.
- **Status codes.** A refusal is a `DomainForbiddenError`; it becomes `403` only when
  `AppExceptionFilter` from `@smartsoft001/nestjs` is registered (otherwise `500`). A missing token
  on upload or delete is `401`.
- **Limits.** One file of at most `attachmentMaxBytes` (default 10 MiB) and at most
  `attachmentMaxFields` extra form fields (default `0`). The file is buffered before storage;
  oversized, multi-file or extra-field requests answer `413` and nothing is stored. The upload
  answers only after the storage write finished.

### Migration

The attachment routes used to have no guard. After upgrading: configure `attachmentPolicy`, register
`AppExceptionFilter`, send a Bearer token on uploads and deletes, and raise `attachmentMaxBytes` or
`attachmentMaxFields` if clients send larger files or extra form fields. Existing files have no
ownership records; the policy decides how to treat them.

## 🛠️ Gateways & Methods

### CrudGateway
<table>
    <tr><td>changes (WebSocket)</td><td>handleFilter — Subscribes to the changes of one entity, <code>{ id }</code>, and emits <code>{ id, type }</code> per change. Requires a JWT and a <code>changePolicy</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

## 🛡️ Query bounds and exports

`GET /` checks the query string before it reaches MongoDB and answers anything outside these bounds with `400 Bad Request`:

- Operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `~=` and repeated keys (joined into one `$in`, at most 100 values). Raw Mongo operators (`$where`, `$`-keys other than `$search`, `field:op=value`) and `/regex/` values are refused: they reach MongoDB as a `$match` stage, where an unbounded operator lets one request keep the database busy (denial of service).
- Field names: letters, digits and underscores, dotted for nested fields, at most 128 characters; `__proto__`, `prototype` and `constructor` are refused.
- `~=` and `$search` are matched literally (the text is escaped before it becomes a regular expression) and are at most 256 characters. Other values are at most 1024 characters, the encoded query at most 4096.
- `limit` is a positive integer, lowered to `maxQueryLimit` (default `100`), which is also the page size when no `limit` is sent. `offset` is an integer from `0` to `10000`; `next` and `last` links beyond it are left out.
- CSV and XLSX exports use `maxExportLimit` (default `10000`) instead. An export without `limit` that matches more rows is refused with `400` rather than truncated, and every export reports the match count in `X-Total-Count`.
- CSV text cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` (also after spaces) or with a tab or line break get a leading apostrophe (OWASP CSV-injection guidance), so `+48 600 000 000` is exported as `'+48 600 000 000`. Numbers are unchanged.

```ts
CrudShellNestjsModule.forRoot({
  // ...
  restApi: true,
  socket: false,
  maxQueryLimit: 500,
  maxExportLimit: 50000,
});
```

The bounds cap what one request asks for, not what it costs: index the fields you filter and sort on, scope data per customer, and set database timeouts and rate limits in the application.

### Upgrading

- A list request without `limit` now returns at most `maxQueryLimit` rows and a larger `limit` is lowered to it: page through the list or raise `maxQueryLimit`.
- An `offset` above `10000` is refused.
- Raw operators and `/regex/` values are refused; use `~=` for a "contains" match.
- Field names containing `__proto__`, `prototype` or `constructor` are refused.
- A `CrudController` subclass that calls `super(service)` gets the default limits; pass the injected `SharedConfig` as the second argument to use the configured ones.

### Change subscriptions

A subscription is refused unless the socket handshake carries a valid JWT in `auth.token`
(`io(url, { auth: { token } })`), the message names one entity with `{ id }`, and
`SharedConfig.changePolicy` returns exactly `true`. The policy receives `{ id, user, type }`. It runs
once on subscribe without `type`, and again before every event, with a fresh token check, with the
change `type` (`create`, `update` or `delete`). A refusal on an event ends the subscription. Decide
from server-side ownership or tenant data, never from the id alone.

- **Events carry no document fields.** Clients receive `{ id, type }` and refetch the entity through
  an authorized endpoint.
- **Deletes.** Mongo emits a `delete` after the document is gone, so a policy that loads the
  document would deny it and the client would never learn about the delete. Branch on
  `type === 'delete'` and decide without loading the document.
- **Cost.** The policy runs per event and per subscriber; keep it cheap or cache it.
- **Token expiry.** The token from the handshake is rechecked on every event. After it expires the
  next event ends the subscription; the client must reconnect with a fresh `auth.token`.
- **Core module.** `CrudShellNestjsCoreModule` always registers the gateway, so every subscription
  is refused until `changePolicy` is set.

#### Migration

Subscriptions used to be open to anyone, accepted an empty filter and carried the full change,
including the inserted document or the update delta. After upgrading: configure `changePolicy`,
connect with the JWT in `auth.token` (and reconnect after it expires), always subscribe with an
`id`, and refetch the entity on each event instead of applying a payload.
