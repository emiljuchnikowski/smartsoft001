## ⚠️ Known Issues Without Available Fixes

### xlsx (High Priority - Production Impact)

**Package**: xlsx@0.18.5  
**Severity**: High  
**CVEs**: 
- GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6 (Prototype Pollution) - Score 7.8
- GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9 (Regular Expression Denial of Service) - Score 7.5

**Status**: No fix available  
**Required Versions**: >= 0.19.3 and >= 0.20.2 (not yet published)  
**Usage**: Critical for Excel export functionality in CRUD operations  
**Files Affected**:
- `packages/crud/shell/nestjs/src/lib/controllers/crud/crud.controller.ts`
- `packages/crud/shell/angular/src/lib/services/crud/crud.service.ts`

**Risk Assessment**:
- Prototype Pollution: Requires ability to control object input to xlsx parsing
- ReDoS: Requires ability to provide malicious regular expression input
- Both require specific attack vectors and are not easily exploitable in normal usage

**Recommendations**:
1. Monitor for xlsx security updates regularly
2. Consider implementing input validation before xlsx processing
3. Evaluate alternative libraries (exceljs, @syncfusion/ej2-excel-export) for future versions
4. Implement rate limiting on export endpoints to mitigate ReDoS impact

### Development Dependencies (Low Priority)

**Package**: @module-federation/enhanced@0.17.1 (via @nx/angular)  
**Issue**: Depends on vulnerable koa version  
**Severity**: Low (development only)  
**Status**: Will be addressed in future Nx updates

## Security Monitoring

- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for xlsx specifically
- Update dependencies monthly or when security patches are available
- All security updates should include running the full test suite

## Last Updated

Security analysis last performed: 2025-09-19  
Next review recommended: 2025-10-19 or when xlsx patches become available
